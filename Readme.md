### Project Goals ### 
The goal of this project is to learn **how to read and write local files, extract specific data from given files and keep project structure to convention** .

---
### Requirements and Expectations ### 

**Requirements**

- A persistent menu that provide users with various input options to interact with the program to manipulate a chosen file

- File manipulation
    - Get the name of the chosen file
    - How big is the file
    - If it is a text file how many lines of text 
    - If it is a text file search for a specific word 
      and how many times that specific word is found in the file
- Logging
    - log all results and function call duration from the file manipulating functionality to a log file and displing log in the console
- Output
   - .java files are to be compiled into .class files and placed in /out/ 
   - The application is to be compiled into a single .jar file and place in /out/
- Screenshots 
    - A screenshot of the "javac" command that will compile all .java files to .class files and put them in /out/
    - A screenshot of the jar command that will compile the application into a single .jar file and place it in /out/
    - A screenshot of the .jar file running in a terminal window showing the persistent menu in the working application 

**Expectations**
- A persistent menu
- user-input delivers the desired output 
- logging to both a log file and console/terminal
